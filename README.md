# Rootstock chain analysis

This repository contains the data and code used to build a Machine Learning model to predict the demand of the WRBTC token after the launch of the Sovryn platform on roostock which allowed users to trade, borrow, and lend Bitcoin.

### Structure 

- the folder called `analysis` contains the `analysis.ipynb` which is a nootebook that contains the analysis steps and the ML model. The `functions.py` is a python script that contains helper functions, for example, to extract the data via the `foorprint API`.
- the folder called `data` contains the raw data used in the analysis. Therefore, a user that wants to replicate the results can do so without the need for his/her own `footprint API Key` to query the results.
- the folder called `plots` stores teh results of the analysis available as `png` files.
